                        <p>Seattle is a big city and the way you navigate around it can give you a very unique perspective of the things going on around you. As UW students, we wanted to represent what our daily lives look like to and around the school. At the same time, we also wanted to include a little of what our lives look like outside the school environment based on the places that we get to visit around the city. Ultimately, we hope that the infographic we created gives a new perspective of Seattle away from the rainy weather and other stereotypes and rather gives an inside look at what we live day by day outside of school.</p>

                        <p>The Emerald City also known as Seattle is one of the many cities on the west coast that stands out for its unique culture and setting. However, it is the different neighborhoods and areas in the city that make it unique and help to set it aside from others. One in particular described as “the fastest growing neighborhood in Seattle, the U District is full of opportunities for visitors, residents, and business owners alike” (The U District Partnership). This is why for this lab I decided to analyze the U-District and more specifically the bars in the area to represent the different nightlife options people who live here have around them.</p>

                        <p>Seattle is a really big city to represent by itself so for our lab we decided to showcase the colors in the view of Mount Rainier as seen from the University of Washington also known as Rainier Vista. As UW students this location not only offered a great way to analyze the weather in Seattle but also a convenient place to do so given its location and its proximity to us. Once the location was set, the data collection process was quite simple since we just made sure that everyone in our group took a picture on each day. We chose the time stamp to be set from 12:30 PM to 5:30 PM so we could more accurately see and represent the changes per day and also throughout it.</p>

                        <p>Grey skies and constant rain might not be everyone’s favorite weather and unfortunately, this has been reflected in studies where Washington as a whole has been ranked as the 22nd happiest state in the country (Kiro 7). However, finding happiness in Seattle lies in the eyes of the beholder, and with it being such a big city, there are a lot of different things for everyone to experience and enjoy. Whether that is visiting one of the many parks around the city or taking a walk around popular neighborhoods such as the U-District or Chinatown, the options are endless for you to find a place to make you happy. Fortunately for us, for this last lab, we got to get a glimpse at the places around Seattle that make the people in GEOG 450 happy so that we can analyze the different categories that make them up.</p>

                        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
                        <p>Our view of the world around us is always deeply impacted by the perspective from which we see it. This is especially the case for such a big and unique city as Seattle with its many different cultures and people that make up part of it. For instance, the perspective of a University of Washington student of the city is very different from that of someone who commutes from Kent to Seattle just to go to work.</p>
                        <p><em>However, one thing that doesn't change is the city itself and everything it has to offer for those who live in or visit. GEOG 450 did a really good job of showcasing this in our class since our various lab projects throughout the quarter allowed us to explore different aspects of Seattle and what it represents from a geographical perspective. This is why for this essay I will be discussing my experience throughout said projects and what they each taught me about the city itself.</em></p>

                        <p><strong><em>1. Seattle in the Eyes of a UW Student</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Transportation is key to every city around the world since it allows people to explore everything they have to offer or to allow them to get from point A to point B. As UW students, our group decided to focus on the different transportation methods we take to reach the same destinations given that we are all taking similar classes and are in the same major. This unique approach to our project allowed us to not only collect data from ourselves but to really stop and reflect on how we each get to campus and how that differentiates from one another. This data collection method showed us that we also tend to visit similar places outside the UW campus itself and it demonstrated how even though Seattle as a whole is a big city, being a UW student can make it feel a lot smaller. We were able to translate this into an infographic that allowed us to showcase our different routes to campus and also taught us a lot about the resources we each use to get there.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong><em>2. A Walk Around the U-District</em></strong></p>
                        <p>If there is one unique characteristic that most cities need to have is a variety of different nightlife entertainment options that people can visit to enjoy and have a good time and this is especially the case for a college campus. Given its location near a campus made up of more than 33,000 students, a population bigger than a lot of small towns across the U.S., the University District is definitely not short on offering a variety of nightlife entertainment options to students and citizens alike (Washington Website). This is why for my second lab I wanted to investigate all the different bars located in this area and everything people had to say about them on the Yelp website. With the help of a Yelp API Key and a data crawler used in the data collection process, I was able to generate a very useful data set while simultaneously gaining valuable insight into the way these automated processes work. After some data cleaning, I was able to create an infographic that showcased 26 different bars in the area accompanied by a map highlighting their location, the comment reviews, and the rating each place received.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Colors of the city</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Washington as a whole is not particularly known for being a sunshine state and unfortunately, Seattle is no exception to this reputation. Most people characterize Seattle as a place that is constantly under grey skies and rainfall but those who live and truly get to experience it know that the city is much more colorful and vibrant than that. This is why for lab 3 my group and I decided to showcase the colors of the city as seen from Rainier Vista on the UW campus by photographing the area at multiple hours for 6 days in a row. This unique approach created an immersive lab experience since we got to interact more with the city itself while simultaneously creating our own data based on the images we gathered and the colors that were being showcased. After running our images through an image processing code to extract the colors present in each pixel, we were able to create an infographic that helped to represent Seattle as more than the grey city that's is known for but rather as the one it really is, one filled with color all around it.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Pursuit of Happiness in Seattle</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Although happiness is very subjective, the places that help us represent this emotion can tell us a lot about the different ways we interact with everything that surrounds us. For our last lab of the quarter, we were asked to do just that, to showcase a happy place around Seattle and to explain our reasoning in the Padlet Map service. This lab was special because not only did we get to share the places that make us happy with one another but we got to create a balloon persona to help us showcase said places. This allowed us to work with a unique data set that we were able to turn into a nice infographic representation. For mine, I decided to highlight it in four different categories: Campus, Attraction, Food, and Outdoors. This allowed me to showcase the data in a sunburst chart where I measured happiness levels based on the total amount of words in the description for each place.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Main Takeaways & Future Projects</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Working on all of these assignments was a really valuable experience because not only did I get to learn and apply new skills to my work but I also got to learn more about the city of Seattle itself. One of my main takeaways from this class is that I got to experience every role in all the projects I got to work on since I planned, programmed, analyzed, and did some data-wrangling. All of which helped me to finish my work and teach me a lot throughout the process. Getting to collaborate with other students in the group project also taught me a lot about the different ways we each experience the city whether that is based on the places we visit or the modes of transportation we each use to get around it.</p>
                        <p><em>Given that this course left me with a really good base to build upon my skills, for future projects I plan to improve the projects I discussed here by adding more detail, information, and changing the overall aesthetics of them. This would not only help me keep on practicing my skills but it would also allow me to provide more depth to the projects I have already created. I also plan on creating new projects that incorporate new ideas surrounding the different neighborhoods and landmarks in Seattle so I can keep on growing my portfolio and getting more experience with the different tools I learned in class.</em></p>
                        
                        <p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Overall, this quarter taught me a lot about what Seattle as a city has to offer and what the geography that surrounds it means for the city and for those who form a part of it. Working on the different group projects and watching the class presentations also allowed me to learn more about how my classmates experience the city and how their experience is similar/different from mine. However, even after everything I still feel like there is a lot left to learn and explore in Seattle which is why I am motivated to use everything I learned in this class to keep on showcasing the city and everything it has to offer. Oftentimes, big cities like this tend to get a bad reputation because of the many underlying problems that surround them but the truth of the matter is that the rich culture that helped to build them to where they are will always be in the spirit of each city and Seattle is no exception.</p>
